# 4-3 Node Embedding



## Embedding and Matrix Factorization

* Recall : Encoder as an **embedding lookup**

* Objective was to maximize $z_v^Tz_u$ for node pair ($u,\ v$) that are **similar**



### Connection to Matrix Factorization and Similarity

* Consider Simple Node similarity
  * Node $u$, $v$ are similar if they are connected by an edge
  * It means $z_v^Tz_u = A_{u, v}$ 
    * Where $A_{u, v} = 1$ if connected
  * So, $Z^TZ = A$

### Matrix Factorization

* Embedding dimension $d$, number of rows in $Z$, is much smaller than number of nodes $n$.
  * 임베딩 하는 차원이 node의 수 보다 적을 수밖에 없다.
* Exact factorization $A = Z^TZ$ is generally not possible
  * Due to dimension difference
* But, we can learn $Z$ approximately



#### Objective : $min_Z \parallel A-Z^TZ \parallel_2$

* Optimize $Z$ such that it minimize the L2 norm of $A - Z^TZ$



#### Conclusion

: Inner product decoder with node similarity defined by edge connectivity
 is equivalent to **matrix factorization of A**





## Random Walk-based Similarity

* **DeepWalk, node2vec** have more complex node similarity definition based on random walks



### DeepWalk

* Equivalent to matrix factorization of following expression


$$
\log\Big(vol(G)\Big( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{r=1}^T (D^{-1}A)^r\Big)D^{-1}\Big)-\log{b}
$$

* $vol(G) = \sum_i\sum_j A_{i, j}$  :  Volume of graph
* $T = \vert N_R(u)\vert$  :  context window size
* $r$ : power of normalized adjacency matrix
* $D_{u, u} = deg(u)$ : diagonal matrix $D$
* $\log{b}$ : number of negative samples



* Node2vec can also be formulated as a matrix factorization



### Limitation

#### 1. Cannot obtain emeddings of node not in training set

* Cannot compute its embedding with DeepWalk or node2vec
  * Need to train all node embeddings again



#### 2. Cannot capture structural similarity

* Node 1 and 11 are **structurally similar**
  * part of triangle, degree 2, ...
* But, they have very different embeddings
  * Random walk from node 1 is unlikely to reach node 11 and vis versa



#### 3. Cannot utilize node, edge and graph features

<img width="589" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84625523/218251733-ffc1760d-3d67-44ea-a604-09fba1e5c267.png" style="zoom:67%;" >

* Our embedding method does not incorporate such node features





### Solution?

* Deep representation Learning and GNN
